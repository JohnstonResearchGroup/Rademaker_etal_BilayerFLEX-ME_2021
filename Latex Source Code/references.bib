We find s$\pm$pairing with a transition temperature that peaks beyond the Lifshitz point and a gap function that has essentially the same magnitude but opposite sign on the incipient hole band as it does on the electron band that has a Fermi surface.},

	Abstract = {We have considered the influence of the momentum structure of the effective electron--phonon interaction on the competition of CDW and superconductivity. Keeping exactly the same effective interaction in both channels (which is natural since both SC and CDW are driven by the same electron--phonon interaction), we produce a phase diagram that shows remarkable similarities with that of the cuprates if we associate the pseudogap with a CDW and the doping effect with particle-hole asymmetry. When the electron--phonon interaction is dominated by the small wavevectors, we can obtain a d-wave superconducting dome, a CDW that follows the behavior of the pseudogap and more surprisingly, a transition with rising temperature from d-wave CDW to s-wave CDW in the underdoped regime. Our d-wave CDW state at low-T provides the first theoretical explanation of recent thermal transport results that identify the same nodal excitations on both sides of the transition line from the non-superconducting to the superconducting regime [M. Sutherland et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 94 (2005) 147004].},

@article{Song:2019cg,
	Abstract = {At the interface between monolayer FeSe films and SrTiO3 substrates the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is unexpectedly high, triggering a surge of excitement. The mechanism for the Tc enhancement has been the central question, as it may present a new strategy for seeking out higher Tc materials. To reveal this enigmatic mechanism, by combining advances in high quality interface growth, 16O {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}leftrightarrow{\$}{\$}↔18O isotope substitution, and extensive data from angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we provide striking evidence that the high Tc in FeSe/SrTiO3 is the cooperative effect of the intrinsic pairing mechanism in the FeSe and interactions between the FeSe electrons and SrTiO3 phonons. Furthermore, our results point to the promising prospect that similar cooperation between different Cooper pairing channels may be a general framework to understand and design high-temperature superconductors.},

@article{Liu:2012di,
	Abstract = {The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in iron-based compounds has attracted much attention. How to further increase the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) and how to understand the superconductivity mechanism are two prominent issues facing the current study of iron-based superconductors. The latest report of high-Tc superconductivity in a single-layer FeSe is therefore both surprising and significant. Here we present investigations of the electronic structure and superconducting gap of the single-layer FeSe superconductor. Its Fermi surface is distinct from other iron-based superconductors, consisting only of electron-like pockets near the zone corner without indication of any Fermi surface around the zone centre. Nearly isotropic superconducting gap is observed in this strictly two-dimensional system. The temperature dependence of the superconducting gap gives a transition temperature Tc\~{} 55 K. These results have established a clear case that such a simple electronic structure is compatible with high-Tc superconductivity in iron-based superconductors.},

@article{Zhang:2020fg,
	Abstract = {The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in single layer FeSe epitaxially grown on SrTiO3(001) substrates has instigated extensive debate over whether its pairing symmetry is conventional sign-preserving s-wave or unconventional sign-changing. Here, we probe the pairing state for single layer FeSe/SrTiO3 grown by molecular beam epitaxy using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. We observe robust in-gap bound states induced by non-magnetic Fe-vacancy defects within the Fe-plane, which exhibit strong spatial electron-hole asymmetry with two-fold symmetry in hole states and four-fold in electron states. The bound states exhibit no energy shift or splitting under an applied magnetic field, consistent with a sign-changing order parameter. This is further confirmed by defect bound state quasiparticle interference that shows a sign-changing behavior with a pair of corresponding peaks at the positive and negative energies near the impurity bound states. Our findings provide unambiguous evidence for a sign-changing pairing symmetry for single layer FeSe/SrTiO3.},
